# GPO Compliance Overview

This document outlines how the GPO (Project Orchestrator) system addresses key compliance requirements for Language Service Providers (LSPs) operating in regulated industries.

## üéØ Overview

GPO is designed to support LSPs in maintaining compliance with various regulatory frameworks by providing intelligent risk assessment, secure data handling, and audit capabilities. The system contributes to compliance efforts but does not guarantee full compliance - organizations must implement comprehensive compliance programs.
