# Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the deployment issues with the GPO application on Render.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Incorrect Start Command**: The original `render.yaml` had a start command that was trying to change directory to `gpo_product` and then run the application, but this was causing issues with the working directory.

2. **Python Package Structure**: The `gpo_product` directory was not properly set up as a Python package, causing import errors.

3. **Import Path Issues**: The application was not correctly importing modules from the `gpo_product` package.

4. **Environment Variable Configuration**: The `PORT` environment variable was hardcoded in `render.yaml` instead of using the value provided by Render.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `render.yaml`

- Changed the build command to use the root `requirements.txt`
- Updated the start command to use `gunicorn app:app` without changing directories
- Removed the hardcoded `PORT` environment variable and used `$PORT` instead

### 2. Improved Python Package Structure

- Enhanced `gpo_product/__init__.py` to properly set up the package
- Added proper imports to make the package more robust
- Added version and author information

### 3. Fixed Import Path Issues

- Updated `app.py` to handle imports from `gpo_product` more robustly
- Added fallback import mechanisms
- Improved error handling for imports

### 4. Added Deployment Tools

- Created `deployment_test.py` to test the deployment configuration
- Added a `Procfile` for Render deployment
- Created detailed deployment documentation in `RENDER_DEPLOY.md`

### 5. Other Improvements

- Added proper logging to help with debugging
- Improved error handling in the main application
- Enhanced directory management to ensure proper working directories

## Testing

The deployment configuration has been tested using the `deployment_test.py` script, which checks:

1. Environment variables
2. Required Python imports
3. Application initialization
4. Database connection

All tests now pass, indicating that the application should deploy successfully to Render.

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Deploy to Render using the instructions in `RENDER_DEPLOY.md`
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues
4. Verify that the application is running correctly on Render
