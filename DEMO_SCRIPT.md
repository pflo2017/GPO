## ðŸ“‹ Demo Script

### Opening (2 minutes)

**"Good morning! Today I'm excited to show you how GPO - our AI-powered Project Orchestrator - is transforming how LSPs manage translation projects from reactive to proactive."**

**"GPO acts as your intelligent co-pilot, using advanced AI to identify risks before they become problems. Let me show you how it works in real-time."**

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Scenario 1: Proactive Risk Mitigation - Sensitive Data Detection

**"Let's start with a critical scenario that every LSP faces: handling sensitive documents."**

### Step 1: Create Project with Sensitive Document
1. **Navigate to Dashboard** â†’ "Create New Project"
2. **Fill in project details:**
   - Client: "LegalTech Solutions"
   - Project Name: "Confidential Merger Agreement"
   - Language Pair: "English-Spanish"
   - Content Type: "Legal Contracts"
   - Due Date: "2024-02-15"
   - Word Count: "25,000"

3. **Upload the legal contract document** (DOCX with confidential clauses)

### Step 2: Show Immediate AI Analysis
**"Watch what happens the moment I upload this document..."**

**Expected Result**: 
- **Risk Status**: "Critical Risk" (red badge)
- **Risk Reason**: "Sensitive data detected: 'Legal Confidential' identified in source document"
- **Recommendation**: "IMMEDIATE ACTION: Halt standard translation. Initiate secure workflow. Consult legal/compliance department."

### Step 3: Highlight the Value
**"This is the power of GPO - it immediately identified that this document contains confidential legal information and automatically triggered the appropriate security protocols. Without GPO, this sensitive content might have been processed through standard workflows, potentially causing compliance violations."**

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Scenario 2: Predictive Deadline Risk Management

**"Now let's look at how GPO predicts and prevents deadline issues."**

### Step 1: Show Existing Project
1. **Navigate to Dashboard**
2. **Find a project that's behind schedule** (or create one with low progress)

### Step 2: Demonstrate Risk Assessment
**"This project has 15,000 words to translate, but only 3,000 completed with 5 days remaining. Let me run a fresh AI analysis..."**

**Click "Run GPO Analysis"**

### Step 3: Show AI Insights
**Expected Result**:
- **Risk Status**: "High Risk" (orange badge)
- **Risk Reason**: "Behind schedule: 3,000 of 15,000 words translated. Only 5 days remaining. Daily requirement: 2,400 words/day"
- **Recommendation**: "Allocate additional linguist resources or negotiate deadline extension. Prioritize high-impact sections."

### Step 4: Highlight Predictive Value
**"GPO didn't just tell us there's a problem - it calculated exactly how many words per day are needed and provided specific, actionable recommendations. This kind of predictive insight allows you to intervene before it's too late."**

## ðŸŽ¬ Scenario 3: Quality Assurance - Complex Content & Linguist Mismatch

**"Quality is everything in translation. Let's see how GPO ensures the right linguist for the right content."**

### Step 1: Create Technical Project
1. **Create new project:**
   - Client: "TechCorp Inc."
   - Project Name: "API Documentation Translation"
   - Content Type: "Technical Manuals"
   - Upload technical manual (with API terminology)

### Step 2: Show AI Document Analysis
**"GPO automatically analyzed this document and found..."**

**Expected Result**:
- **Complexity Score**: "High"
- **Terminology Flag**: "True"
- **Terminology Details**: ["API", "SDK", "integration", "deployment", "configuration"]
- **Summary**: "Technical manual for software integration with detailed API documentation"

### Step 3: Show Risk Assessment
**"Now GPO assesses the project risks based on this analysis..."**

**Expected Result**:
- **Risk Status**: "Medium Risk"
- **Risk Reason**: "High density of specialized terminology detected for 'Technical Manuals' content"
- **Recommendation**: "Ensure linguist has access to updated glossaries/TMs. Recommend a specialized terminology review step."

### Step 4: Highlight Quality Protection
**"GPO automatically detected that this document contains complex technical terminology and immediately flagged the need for specialized handling. This prevents quality issues before they occur."**

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Scenario 4: Resource Load Management

**"Finally, let's see how GPO optimizes your most valuable resource - your linguists."**

### Step 1: Show Linguist Dashboard
1. **Navigate to project with assigned linguist**
2. **Show linguist details** (high workload, large project)

### Step 2: Demonstrate Resource Risk
**"This linguist has a 'High' current workload and is assigned to a 30,000-word project. Let's see what GPO thinks..."**

**Expected Result**:
- **Risk Status**: "Medium Risk"
- **Risk Reason**: "Linguist 'Dr. Maria Rodriguez' has high current workload for a large project (30,000 words)"
- **Recommendation**: "Monitor linguist's progress closely. Be prepared to reallocate parts of the project."

### Step 3: Highlight Resource Optimization
**"GPO automatically monitors linguist workload and alerts you when assignments might impact quality or deadlines. This proactive approach prevents burnout and ensures optimal resource utilization."**

---

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Overview

**"Let me show you the big picture - how GPO gives you complete visibility across all your projects."**

### Step 1: Show Risk Distribution
- **Point out risk distribution chart**
- **Highlight critical and high-risk projects**
- **Show trend analysis**

### Step 2: Demonstrate Real-time Monitoring
- **Show live project status**
- **Point out automatic updates**
- **Highlight actionable insights**

### 2. AI-Powered Intelligence
**"GPO doesn't just use rules - it uses advanced AI to understand document content, assess complexity, and provide contextual recommendations."**

### 3. Compliance Protection
**"GPO automatically detects sensitive content and ensures proper handling, protecting you from compliance violations and data breaches."**

### 4. Resource Optimization
**"GPO helps you optimize your most valuable resource - your linguists - by ensuring the right person for the right project."**

### 5. Actionable Insights
**"GPO doesn't just tell you there's a problem - it tells you exactly what to do about it with specific, actionable recommendations."**
